I am a PhD student at the University of Tuebingen and International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems where I work under the supervision of Robert Bamler. My research focuses on the interface between deep learning and probabilistic modeling. Specifically, I am interested in developing Bayesian deep learning models that can reliably estimate the uncertainty of their predictions.

My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Communication Systems from EPFL and a Master's degree in Computer Science from ETH Zurich. During my time at ETH Zurich, I worked on applying Bayesian inference to the transformer and was supervised by Vincent Fortuin, Alexander Immer, Max Horn, and Gunnar Rätsch.

Before starting my PhD, I worked at Amazon as an intern, where I collaborated with Artur Bekasov and Tammo Rukat on uncertainty modeling in gradient boosting machines with applications to bandits. 

Overall, my goal is to contribute to the development of deep learning models by improving priors and inference techniques.
